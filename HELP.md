## Observability with Wavefront

If you don't have a Wavefront account, the starter will create a freemium account for you.
The URL to access the Wavefront Service dashboard is logged on startup.

You can also access your dashboard using the `/actuator/wavefront` endpoint.

Finally, you can opt-in for distributed tracing by adding the Spring Cloud Sleuth starter.
